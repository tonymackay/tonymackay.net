        I am a Linux system administrator with experience installing, configuring and monitoring multiple distributions.
        I have a solid understanding of virtualization, having planned, designed and implemented VMware solutions, both on-premises and in the data centre.
        I also hold a BSc (Hons) degree in Applied Computing, which I studied at Northumbria University.
